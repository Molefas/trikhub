# Task Completion Workflow

Please follow this checklist:

## Code Review Request
- [ ] Summarize what was changed
- [ ] List files modified
- [ ] Note any potential breaking changes
- [ ] Highlight areas that need careful testing

**Waiting for your review and testing confirmation before proceeding.**

Once you confirm the changes work, I will:
1. Check if documentation updates are needed
2. Create a feature branch
3. Commit with appropriate message
4. Create a PR with full description
